"""Recompute every case's tags from the vocabulary.

ONE command, not a backfill followed by a curation pass. It recomputes from scratch
on every run:

    tags = resolve(tags_source) ∪ curation.add − curation.remove

Two sequential mutating commands would mean re-running the first silently wipes what
the second wrote. Recomputing from two files instead makes the result a pure function
of the inputs: order-independent, re-runnable, and reproducible from the repo.

    uv run python manage.py rebuild_case_tags --dry-run
    uv run python manage.py rebuild_case_tags --apply

`tags_source` is written only when NULL, so the pre-cleanup snapshot survives every
re-run — that is what makes this reversible.

SCOPE: published cases only, unless ``--all``. The vocabulary and its aliases were
measured against the 82 PUBLISHED cases (``00-inventory.md``: 144 distinct raw values).
The rest of the table is ~2950 bulk-imported CIAA Special Court cases carrying a
different, mostly-Nepali tag set that no alias covers — ``भ्रष्टाचार`` alone is on 2685
of them. Running unscoped strips tags from those cases rather than canonicalising them,
so the default matches the corpus the vocabulary was actually built for. ``--all`` stays
available for when the vocabulary has grown to cover them.
