"""DRF serializers for the NES Queue System (NESQ).

Provides request and response serializers for the NESQ API endpoints:

- ``NESQueueSubmitSerializer``: Validates incoming submission requests
  (action, payload, change_description, auto_approve).
- ``NESQueueItemSerializer``: Formats queue items for API responses,
  resolving user foreign keys to usernames.

    Fields:

            review and is created with status=APPROVED. Only Admin/Moderator
            users may set this to True; the view enforces that constraint.
