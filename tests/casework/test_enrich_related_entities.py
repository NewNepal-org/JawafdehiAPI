"""Tests for the DB-free related-entities enricher
(casework/enrich_related_entities.py): LLM extraction, deterministic NES
resolution (`casework/entity_resolver.py`), and the conditional bind write.

ARCHITECTURE FINDING (see module docstring for the full writeup, escalated and
confirmed with the dispatcher before any code was written): the donor
(0321a85) writes entities via `api.create_entity(display_name=name, nes_id="")`
-- a method that does not exist on this branch's `CaseworkApi` and never has.
The CURRENT schema (`cases/caseworker_serializers.py::EntityPatchItemSerializer`)
requires `{"nes_id": <canonical NES @id IRI>, "relationship_type", "outcome"?,
"notes"}` and explicitly has "no display-name fallback". This port's resolver
turns an LLM-extracted name into a confirmed `nes_id` deterministically (no
fuzzy matching, no LLM call, `MIN_BIND_SCORE = 0.85`) and only ever binds an
entity NES already has -- an unmatched name is reported, never minted.

BRIEF-VS-DONOR DIFFERENCE: the brief's suggested `validate_entity_item`
function (canonical `nes_id` + accused-only `outcome` validation) does not
exist anywhere in the donor -- it matches the CURRENT serializer, not any
donor behavior, so it is NOT implemented here (`test_donor_never_defines_
validate_entity_item`). Same phantom-function shape as `normalise_missing_
details` (14b) and `validate_timeline_items` (14c).

`TestDonorFidelity` re-derives every slicing constant, the system prompt, and
the `tier`/`max_tokens` LLM-call arguments directly from the donor at commit
`0321a85` (via `git show` + `ast`, never by trusting this file's own
transcription).

# Task 6 -- bind planning and the merge.
#
# Two corrections to the original brief, both load-bearing (see task-6-report.md
# for the full writeup):
#
# 1. `plan_case_entities` must apply Task 5's document veto
#    (`casework.entity_resolver.apply_document_veto`) before a BIND is trusted:
#    `resolve()` alone will bind Election Commission candidate/ward-head
#    records that share a name with the real case subject. The document read
#    fails closed -- an unreadable document (None/empty/non-dict, or an
#    exception from `get_entity`) downgrades the BIND to REVIEW, never lets it
#    survive.
# 2. Binding is SECTION-SCOPED, not `related`-only. An extracted item binds into
#    whatever section its own `relationship_type` names, for any of the nine the
#    case API accepts -- so a `location`-typed item binds into `location`. Only an
#    unrecognised section goes straight to `plan.review` before a search is spent,
#    because there is no section to file it under. (This reverses the original
#    brief, which refused every section but `related`; the scope was widened on
#    request because the refusal cost recall.)

# THE HARM THIS REMOVES: an accused bind carries `outcome = CHARGED`, and since
# 2026-08-05 one extracted name binds EVERY candidate above the threshold. An
# ambiguous accused name therefore recorded every namesake as charged in a
