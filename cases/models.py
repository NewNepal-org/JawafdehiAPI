    Student)" on three of Sambhav Koirala's eleven cases and nowhere else — not
    because his role differed case to case, but because a hand-copied line drifts.

    The trade-off, accepted deliberately: a title goes stale ("BALLB 4th Year
    Student" will not be true next year), and updating it changes the byline on

    byline points at a person, it does not freeze them.
