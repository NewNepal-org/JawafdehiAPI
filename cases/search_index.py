"""Unified-search indexer for Jawafdehi cases (``jawafdehi-cases`` index).

Projects a ``Case`` into the common index doc. CASE-ONLY-PUBLISHED RULE (plan
§5, decision #6): only ``state == PUBLISHED`` cases enter the index — the search
index is all-public, so there is NO visibility/ACL field. ``index(case)`` upserts
when published and DELETES from the index when the case is not published (so a
case that leaves PUBLISHED is removed). ``should_index(case)`` exposes the rule.

Field mapping:
* ``iri``            ← ``Case.public_iri`` (``https://jawafdehi.org/case/<slug>``,
  minted at publish — the document ``_id``),
* ``type``           ← ``"Case"`` (+ the platform ``case_type`` in keywords),
* ``title_ne/en``    ← ``Case.title`` (script-bucketed; cases store one title),
* ``title_translit`` ← shared transliteration of the title,
* ``body``           ← ``description`` + ``key_allegations`` (joined),
* ``keywords``       ← ``tags`` (+ ``case_type``),
* ``identifiers``    ← the IRI, the slug, and the ``court_cases`` references,
* ``date``           ← ``trial_start_date`` (else created date),
* ``case_status``    ← coarse ongoing/closed/others (mirrors the SPA rule); a
  dedicated keyword (NOT the generic ``status``, which NGM uses for its scraper
  enrichment flag) so the unified search can facet/filter cases without collision,
* ``bigo``           ← ``Case.bigo`` (बिगो, whole NPR) promoted to a top-level
  ``long`` so the unified search can RANGE-filter on it; the card copy under
  ``raw`` is return-only (``raw`` is ``enabled: false``, hence unqueryable),
* ``raw``            ← a light record PLUS a ``card`` payload (return-only): every
  field the SPA case list/card renders — ``short_description``, ``key_allegations``,
  ``tags``, dates, ``bigo``, thumbnail/banner, the ``timeline`` (major events), and
  the resolved entity binds — denormalized so a search hit renders WITHOUT a
  second fetch to ``/api/cases/{slug}/``.

Denormalized entity names come from NES at index time, so a case must be
re-indexed when a referenced entity is renamed (a scheduled ``reindex_cases``
reconcile covers this — see the plan's WS3); the write-time signals only fire on
``Case`` itself.

Best-effort: ``index`` / ``delete`` log and swallow an OpenSearch error, because
they run from write-time signals where a search blip must not fail a case save.
``index_now`` / ``delete_now`` are the same functions without the swallow, for
callers that have a retry budget to spend on the failure.
