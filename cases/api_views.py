    A plain Django ``View``, NOT a DRF ``APIView``, and deliberately so. DRF

    view whose renderers do not advertise ``image/jpeg`` answers 406 to any
    client that asks for an image — which is exactly what the frontend Worker
    sends (``Accept: image/jpeg,image/*``). The whole feature would have failed
    closed in production while every test passed, because DRF's APIClient sends
    ``Accept: */*`` by default and that matches anything. Nothing here needs DRF:
    there is no serializer, no auth beyond public, and the body is raw bytes.
    The cost is that the endpoint is absent from the OpenAPI schema, which is
    normal for an image route.

    The rendered bytes are cached server-side under the profile's own

    # regression paid by the person least able to work around it.

    # ``AuditlogActorMixin`` binds the DRF-authenticated user so a triage edit is
    # attributed to whoever made it. Note the trail is NOT a privacy control:
    # auditlog's ``mask_fields`` (cases/apps.py) replaces only the first half of

    - `url` (required): a supported jawafdehi.org share URL to embed
    - `format` (optional): response format — `json` (default) or `xml`

    Supported URLs are public case pages, live update pages, and public entity
    registry pages.
    Returns a `rich` type embed with an iframe pointing to the embed card.
