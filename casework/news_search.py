"""Find and verify news articles about a CIAA case. READ-ONLY -- writes nothing, anywhere.

The read half of `casework/enrich_news_articles.py`, split out because the two
halves have opposite risk profiles. Everything here does network READS (web
search, article fetch, web-archive lookup) and LLM calls; nothing here can
create a material, bind evidence, or touch the case API. The write half is one
function in the enricher (`apply_plan`), which is also the only place that
imports `CaseworkApi`. That is `bind_materials.py`'s single-writer discipline:
read-only candidate producers, one writer, a quarantine gate between them.

Ported from the donor `casework/enrich_news_articles.py` (recovered at
`0321a85`, 1,957 lines). The search plumbing, HTML/date parsing, URL screening,
query generation and the two-tier verification prompt are the donor's and are
kept; donor line numbers are cited where a constant or rule is pinned. The
web-archive half comes from the second donor, the deleted
`cases/management/commands/add_news_permalinks.py` (recovered at `4c39d8c^`).

Deliberate deviations from the donor live in the enricher's module docstring,
except the two that are wholly inside this module:

DEVIATION A -- AN ARTICLE WITH NO PUBLICATION DATE IS DROPPED, AND REPORTED.
The donor bound it and defaulted the date to `trial_start_date` or *today*
(`_publication_date`, donor:1680). The permalinks donor refused the same rows
outright ("NEWS sources with no publication_date are skipped and reported, not
modified"), and this port follows the stricter one. Two reasons beyond
consistency: a citation dated "today" is a fabricated fact in the one artefact
whose job is provenance, and this stage derives a material's IRI from the
publication date (see `news_material_ident`), so a missing date would make the
IRI non-reproducible and defeat the idempotency check. `SkipReason.NO_DATE`
rows are counted and listed, never silently dropped.

DEVIATION B -- THE ACCEPTANCE BAR IS `confidence == "high"`, NOT `relevant ==
true`. The donor bound anything the premium verifier called relevant at any
confidence (donor:1080). The brief requires zero false positives on the
labelled set and near-misses reported for human confirmation rather than bound,
and the donor's own rubric is what makes `high` the right line: its prompt
grades "matching on case number alone" as STRONG and "defendant name +
corruption allegations" as MEDIUM (donor:173-174). Medium is therefore the
literal description of this enricher's worst failure -- the same accused's other
case. Production already carries two such binds on
`vikal-paudel-080-cr-0174-illegal-assets`; see `tests/casework/news_labelled_set.py`.
A relevant-but-not-high verdict becomes a `NearMiss`, which the review file
prints for a human and the writer never touches.

      2082 BS / 2026 AD.

    mid-April, so two verdict entries in the same AD year can sit in different
    BS years and picking the wrong one narrows the query onto a year the story
    was not filed under.

    # Bahadur Shahi CIAA Nepal corruption" that had found the article at rank 7
    # was no longer being sent. But the model also found the one article no
    # name query reaches -- the Melamchi case, via the PROJECT name and the
    # contractor. The two are complementary and the budget has room for both.

    # a misspelling and displace the model's correct romanisation. There it

VERIFY_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are a fact-checking assistant for a Nepal corruption accountability platform. You
are given ONE CIAA Special Court corruption case and a NUMBERED LIST of candidate news
articles. For EACH candidate, decide whether it is genuinely about the SAME case.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object containing exactly one result per candidate index:
{"results": [
  {"index": 0, "relevant": true, "confidence": "high|medium|low", "reason": "<English>", "event_type": "investigation|filing|hearing|verdict|appeal|other", "summary": "<Nepali (Devanagari) evidence note, 350-500 characters>"},
  {"index": 1, "relevant": false, "reason": "<English>"}
]}

Event types for the "event_type" field:
- "investigation" — CIAA is investigating or completed investigation phase
- "filing" — CIAA filed the charge sheet at Special Court
- "hearing" — court hearing, proceedings, or bench session coverage
- "verdict" — Special Court verdict, decision, or conviction
- "appeal" — Supreme Court appeal or review
- "other" — relevant article that does not clearly fit the above categories

Rules:
- The article must reference the same corruption case, not just mention the same person in an unrelated context.
- Matching on case number alone is strong evidence of relevance.
- Matching on defendant name + corruption allegations is medium evidence.
- If the article is about a different corruption case involving the same person, it is NOT relevant. This is the single most common error: a senior official often faces several separate CIAA cases, and an article about another of them is not evidence for this one.
- If the article is about the same person but not about corruption allegations, it is NOT relevant.
- If a candidate excerpt is mostly navigation menus, category listings, or site boilerplate with only a headline and one sentence of real content, return relevant=false with reason "insufficient article content — likely paywalled or thin page".
- When relevant=true, BOTH "event_type" and "summary" are REQUIRED. event_type must never be an empty string (use "other" if unsure); summary must be in Nepali (Devanagari).
- When relevant=false, omit event_type and summary.

CONFIDENCE RULES — only "high" is ever attached to this case as evidence, so grade strictly:
- "high": the article identifies THIS case unambiguously. Either it states the court case number, or it matches on a combination that could not describe a different case — the same institution AND the same scheme AND a बिगो/loss figure or defendant set that matches this case's.
- "medium": the accused's name and a corruption allegation match, but nothing rules out a DIFFERENT case involving the same person or a similarly-named person. A shared surname, a shared scheme type, or a shared institution alone is medium, not high.
- "low": only weak or circumstantial overlap.
When you cannot tell "high" from "medium", answer "medium". A missed article costs a caseworker five minutes; a wrongly attached one publicly links named people to a case they may have nothing to do with.

SUMMARY — write the Nepali evidence note a caseworker would file, matching this register:
"यो समाचार लेख यस मुद्दा (080-CR-0136) मा अभियोग दायर भएको तथ्य र आयोगका प्रमुख दाबीहरू — रु. ३ करोड २१ लाख स्रोत नखुलेको सम्पत्ति आर्जन — लाई पुष्टि गर्ने पूरक सामग्रीका रूपमा रहन्छ। यो प्राथमिक कानूनी अभिलेख नभई सञ्चारमाध्यमको प्रतिवेदन भएकोले सम्बद्ध आरोपलाई समर्थन गर्ने गौण प्रमाणका रूपमा यसको भूमिका रहन्छ।"
State the case number, what specifically the article confirms (amounts, named
defendants, ऐन/दफा, the outcome), and close by placing its evidentiary weight —
whether it is a primary record (a verdict it reports directly) or secondary
journalistic corroboration. Ground every claim in the excerpt; invent nothing.

DATES IN THE SUMMARY — this note is stored permanently, so a date that only made sense on the day the article ran is worthless to the caseworker who reads it in three years:
- NEVER copy a relative day from the article. "आइतबारदेखि बहस सुरु भयो" tells a later reader nothing. Resolve it against the candidate's "Published" line and write the actual date.
- ALWAYS carry the year. "असार १८ गते" without a year is unusable; "२०८१ असार १८ गते" is a fact.
- For the article's own publication date, write Bikram Sambat first with Gregorian in brackets: २०८१ असार २ (16 June 2024). The "Published" line gives you both calendars — COPY from it. Do not convert between AD and BS yourself, and do not infer a BS date the line does not state. If "Published" is unknown and the article gives only a relative day, omit the date rather than guessing one.
- For a date the ARTICLE ITSELF states (a filing date, a hearing date, a verdict date), keep whichever calendar the article used and do NOT convert it — but always write it in Devanagari: "सन् २०२४ फेब्रुअरी १८", never "18 February 2024". A Latin-script date in a Nepali note is a defect.

    existed, and this note is the one artefact whose job is provenance. The model
    is handed both forms and told to copy, not compute.

    Best-effort on the BS half: `ad_to_bs` is total and returns None for an
    out-of-range year or a missing `nepali` package, in which case the AD date
    alone still anchors any relative day in the article.

    the date was the row's CREATION date (every one of the 33 IN_REVIEW news
    materials reads `20260608`, the day of that batch) and the hex was random.
