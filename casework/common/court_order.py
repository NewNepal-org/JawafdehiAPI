"""Character-anchored readers that pick which part of a court order an LLM sees.

Four readers, two consumers. The extraction reads `court_order_head` (caption,
party list and bench, which sit in the first 3% of all 38 orders in the sample)
plus `court_order_thahar` (a window forward from the `ठहर खण्ड` marker, the
operative section). A per-defendant verdict reads `court_order_verdict_zone`
(marker to end). `court_order_tail` is the ending, and the fallback both
marker-anchored readers use when an order carries no marker.

Every limit is an absolute character count, never a percentage of the input: a
tail is roughly 12% of a document, and on the 379,484-char order in the sample
that is 45,538 chars, past PROMPT_HARD_MAX on its own.

Capture ONLY what the judgment states — never infer or invent:
- फैसला मिति (judgment date) and the इजलास / न्यायाधीशहरू (the bench, by name).
- नि.नं. / मुद्दा नं. and the parties (वादी / प्रतिवादीहरू).
- For EACH defendant: the outcome — दोषी (convicted, with कैद/जरिवाना/बिगो असुल) or
  सफाई (acquitted) — and the court's key reasoning for it.
- Any legal principle the court applied or relied on, noting whether it cites a
  Supreme Court precedent (नजिर) — a Special Court ruling does not itself set one.
- The disputed बिगो the court accepted or rejected, and why.
- Every concrete DATE the judgment cites for a factual event (the alleged conduct,
  bids, committee decisions, payments, registrations, complaint, chargesheet) —
  keep the BS date as written; a downstream timeline extractor relies on these.
