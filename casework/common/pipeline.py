# casework/common/pipeline.py
"""Stage registry and prerequisite DAG.

The donor management commands (`enrich_missing_bigo`, `enrich_tags`,
`enrich_timeline`, `enrich_allegations`, `enrich_related_entities`) were five
standalone commands with no shared sequencing -- each one independently
re-derived "can I run on this case?" from scratch, and none of them knew
about the others. This module is new design, not a port: it is the single
place that says what depends on what, and the single place that says why a
stage did NOT run on a given case.

The dependency chain starts at the MATERIAL, not at a case field like
`bigo`. A case with evidence bound but no MARKDOWN-role material cannot be
enriched -- that is a prerequisite failure, not an error, and it must
surface as an explicit unmet-prerequisite reason, never as a silent skip
indistinguishable from "already enriched" (see `materials.source_text`,
which this module intentionally mirrors in spirit: report why, don't just
return empty).

Stage names are shared with `casework.common.llm.TIERS` -- keep the two in
lockstep (see `test_stage_names_match_llm_tier_names`); a mismatch there
degrades silently (`tier_for` just returns the default tier) rather than
raising, so nothing else will catch a rename here.
