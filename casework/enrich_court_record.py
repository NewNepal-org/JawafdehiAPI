"""Accused binds and case dates, read from the case's own NGM court record.

No source documents, and no Django at IMPORT (the guard test pins that) --
though `bootstrap()` does configure it at runtime on any run that holds a name,
for the one comparison call below. The court record states these facts rather
than inferring them: a defendant is a defendant because a charge sheet says so,
and a verdict date is a verdict date because the Special Court's docket says so.

ONE THING IS NOT IN THE COURT RECORD: whether two cases naming the same person
mean the same human being. Those rows carry a name and nothing else -- no
address on any of the 1,414 in the census -- so `held_names` holds such a name
and `casework.held_identity` asks the model to compare the cases' press
releases, which do state district and office. That is this stage's only model
call, it fires once per HELD name rather than per case, and an answer that is
not high-confidence leaves the name held exactly as before. `--no-held-compare`
turns it off, restoring a run that spends no tokens at all.

WHAT IT WRITES, in one conditional PATCH per case (`CaseworkApi.patch_case`):

  trial_start_date  the earliest registration date across the case's court
                    references, and only when the field is currently empty.
  trial_end_date    the latest deciding-hearing date, and only when the field
                    is empty AND every court reference on the case has decided.
  entities          the existing bind list with new `accused` binds appended --
                    a whole-list replace of a list merged in application code,
                    never a delta (`merge_entity_binds`).

MEASURED COVERAGE (2026-08-07, anonymous GET, all 307 cases of the FY078/079
census): 307/307 carry a registration date, 306/307 carry an end date, and
307/307 name at least one defendant (1,343 rows). The rule reproduces the
hand-entered convention -- start matches on 46 of 48 published cases, end on
29 of 29 where a deciding hearing exists.

WHY NOT THE SCORED RESOLVER. `casework.entity_resolver` binds the best candidate
above a threshold. NES holds 162,650 person entities dominated by Election
Commission candidate records, so a scored match can name a namesake as the
accused in a corruption case -- the worst error this platform can make. This
module matches on exact name equality within the `person` prefix, and creates a
NEW entity when there is no unique exact match. Where that works the failure
mode is a duplicate entity, which is a merge, not a defamation.

WHERE THE CREATION COLLIDES, NOTHING IS BOUND. A 409 on the create says the slug
this name yields is already TAKEN -- and by an entity the ladder just declined to
identify, because a unique exact match would have bound at rung 2 and never
reached the POST at all. The collision is therefore rung 2's own refusal
condition restated: this name is not unique to this person. So the 409 path binds
nothing. It reports `failed`, names the IRI that was taken, and leaves the case
for a human. Keeping the pre-POST IRI and binding it -- what this module did
until 2026-08-07 -- silently converts "I could not identify this person" into "I
identified this person", on exactly the common names the truncation veto was
written for. The cost is a bind this run does not make; the alternative is the
one error this platform must never make.

WHY IT NEVER WRITES `convicted`. `decision_type` sits on the CASE, not on each
defendant. `ठहर` on a 19-defendant case does not say who, and `आंशिक ठहर` means
some were convicted and some cleared. `सफाई` is a whole-case acquittal, so it
alone is distributed to each defendant -- and only ever corrects an unfairly
plain "Accused" label. `charged` is true by construction everywhere else: every
case in this corpus is a Special Court `-CR-` case, so CIAA filed a charge sheet.

THE HOLD IS SCOPED TO ONE RUN, AND TO THE ENRICHABLE STATES. `held_names` only
sees a name on 2+ cases INSIDE the current selection, so `--limit`, `--slug`,
`--court-case`, `--batch-csv`, or a narrow `--fiscal-year` can each shrink
that selection below the cases sharing a name -- silently disabling the hold
for exactly the pair it exists to catch. An unrestricted sweep does not fix
this the way it might seem to: `casework.common.select.select_cases` filters
bulk selection to `ENRICHABLE_STATES` (DRAFT, IN_REVIEW), so a name already
bound as accused on a PUBLISHED case is invisible to the index by
construction, not by narrowing -- and PUBLISHED is exactly where a confirmed
bind already lives. Widening the index past that state gate is a
cost/coverage call for a human, not something this module defaults to. The
run log states both limits every run (`step="held_index"`) and warns
separately when the selection looks narrowed or a pass-1 read shrank it.

    person", so the cross-case reuse this map exists to perform is exactly
    wrong for it, and the key must not let the second case find the first's
    entry.

    The case slug, not the discriminator: two split cases bound to the same
    single district produce the SAME discriminator, so keying on that shares
    the entry again and hands case B case A's entity -- reintroducing the merge

    `held_identity.splittable` refuses that verdict up front; this keying is the

    NAME PLUS ADDRESS, never the bare name. `run_entities` is shared across
    every case in the run so that one person named on two cases becomes ONE
    entity rather than two. Keyed on the name alone that reuse is
    indiscriminate: two DIFFERENT people who merely share a name, each a
    defendant on a different case, collapse into a single entity, and case A's
    person then carries case B's accusation -- the same wrong-person bind the
    match rungs refuse, arriving through the create rung instead.

    `address` is the only other identifying column NGM stores on a party
    (`courts.serializers`'s `CaseEntitySerializer` exposes `side`, `name`,
    `address`, `nes_id` and nothing else), and it is what the charge sheet uses
    to tell namesakes apart, so it is what separates them here.

    EMPTY-TOLERANT, and the residual hole is deliberate: a row with no address
    keys on `(name, "")` and still reuses across cases, so two same-named,
    address-less defendants on two cases can still collapse. Closing that would
    mean keying on the case, which defeats the cross-case reuse this map exists
    for and mints a duplicate entity for every case a person appears on. Both

    """`(decided, is_plain_acquittal)` for one court reference.

    `decided` reuses `_reference_end`'s own truth -- non-empty means decided --
    so this function and `_reference_end` (and therefore `bind_outcome` and
    `end_date`) can never disagree about whether a reference has concluded. A
    reference decided only through the `case_status` paren-date fallback (29
    cases in the census carry only that source, per `_reference_end`'s own
    docstring) carries no outcome text at all, so it is `decided` but never
    `is_plain_acquittal` -- conservative in the direction this function
    already leans, since CHARGED is the default outcome throughout.

    `is_plain_acquittal` is read off the deciding hearing's `decision_type`
    ONLY, and only when that free-text cell says `सफाई` and nothing else
    qualifies it. The hearings API returns raw portal text, and this corpus
    contains compounds that qualify the word rather than standing alone (e.g.
    `आदेश >> आंशिक कसुर ठहर सजाय निर्धारणको लागि पेश गर्ने`). `courts.case_status`'s
    own hearing-decision map puts `आंशिक` first for exactly this reason -- a
    bare substring test on `ठहर` once recorded 593 court_cases as a full
    CONVICTED from a cell that actually said `आंशिक ...ठहर`. The same care
    applies here: a cell naming `आंशिक` or `ठहर` alongside `सफाई` is not a plain
    acquittal, so it is refused rather than guessed at.

    The cell is normalised through `courts.case_status._order_key` before any
    of that testing, not compared raw. The portal spells `आंशिक` two more ways
    in this corpus (`आंशीक`, `आशिंक` -- `_order_key`'s own `_ORDER_SPELLING`
    table says so), and a misspelled qualifier must block ACQUITTED exactly as
    well as the canonical spelling does. `_order_key` is already how this same
    `decision_type`/`order_type` text is normalised elsewhere in that module
    (`outcome_from_hearings`'s own fallback branch), so this reuses the one
    normalisation the corpus's hearing text already goes through, rather than
    hand-copying its variant table and drifting from it later.
