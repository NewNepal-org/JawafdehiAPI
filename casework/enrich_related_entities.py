"""Extract CIAA Special Court case entities via LLM, then resolve each extracted
name to an existing NES entity and bind it into the section it was extracted under
(accused, alleged, related, witness, location, ...).

Ported from the deleted `casework/enrich_related_entities.py` (recovered at
donor commit `0321a85`, 553 lines). Reads a case's press-release AND/OR
court-order source text entirely over the Jawafdehi HTTP API and asks the
premium LLM tier to extract related/location entities plus short accused-person
notes, in one response.

THE DONOR'S WRITE SHAPE (0321a85, no longer valid against this branch):
    entity_id = api.create_entity(display_name=name, nes_id="")        # donor line 510
    entities_to_patch.append({"entity": entity_id,
                               "relationship_type": rel_type_enum,
                               "notes": notes})                        # donor lines 522-528
    api.patch_field(slug, "entities", entities_to_patch)                # donor line 543
The donor blindly minted a brand-new entity for every LLM-extracted name, with
NO NES resolution at all -- keyed by a flat `entity` id, no `nes_id`, no
`outcome`. `CaseworkApi.create_entity` does not exist on this branch and never
has during this porting project, and it still does not exist: entities are
owned by NES and must already exist there before this module can bind one --
an unmatched name is reported for human review or in the no-match file, never
minted.

THE CURRENT SCHEMA (`cases/caseworker_serializers.py::EntityPatchItemSerializer`)
requires every `/entities` item to be
    {"nes_id": <canonical NES @id IRI, validated by is_valid_entity_iri>,
     "relationship_type": ..., "outcome"?: <ACCUSED-role only>, "notes": ...}
"The bind holds the canonical NES entity id directly; entities are owned by
NES and must already exist there (no display-name fallback)" (serializer
comment, verbatim).

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES: the deterministic resolver lives in
`casework/entity_resolver.py` -- matching an extracted name against NES search
candidates is entirely score-based, with `MIN_BIND_SCORE = 0.85`; there is no
fuzzy/edit-distance matching and no LLM call anywhere in the matching step.

BY DEFAULT EVERY NAME THAT MATCHED AN NES ENTITY IS BOUND, into the section its
own `relationship_type` names -- any of the nine `cases.models.RelationshipType`
accepts. When several entities tie above the threshold, the best-scoring one wins
by a deterministic `(-score, nes_id)` sort, so some binds WILL name the wrong
namesake. That is the accepted cost of the mode; every such bind is marked
`[UNCERTAIN]` on the console and carries a `promoted over:` reason in
`*.binds.jsonl`, which is how they are found again. Measured on the hand-labelled
resolver set from commit `67d5293` (it scores name-to-NES resolution only, never
which names the extractor found): precision 0.872, recall 0.872, and
all five wrong binds are Election Commission candidate records rather than
namesake mix-ups.

ONE REFUSAL SURVIVES THAT MODE:

* AN UNREADABLE ENTITY DOCUMENT (`apply_document_veto`'s fail-closed branch). One
  403 or 502 would otherwise bind whichever namesake sorted first with nothing
  having been checked at all.

A CROSS-SCRIPT-ONLY MATCH USED TO BE THE SECOND, and is now bound (2026-08-05:
this stage produces no review queue, and which entities are real is a later
pass). The risk it guarded is real and unmitigated: कमल थापा scores 0.96 against
a `Kamala Thapa` entity and 0.00 against कमला थापा, so the bind can name a woman
in a case charging a man. `resolve` still reports the veto, so the reason text
survives on the bind row in `*.binds.jsonl` -- that file is where such a bind is
found again.

`--strict` is the conservative pipeline: an ambiguity or a veto goes to the review
report instead of binding. Same labelled set: precision 1.000, recall 0.846.

Either way a name with NO NES candidate goes to the no-match report -- there is
nothing to choose between, and this module never creates an NES entity.

EVERY name comes from the extraction. `accused` is a section the LLM may use like
any other; it is NOT also read from the case's NGM court record. That path was
removed: it needs neither a document nor an LLM, so living here put it behind five
gates it has no use for -- the already-enriched skip, the MARKDOWN-role
prerequisite, the no-source gate, the empty-prompt gate, and an LLM failure. A case
with a complete court record and five named defendants bound none of them whenever
its press-release PDF lacked a MARKDOWN role, and a token-cap failure on
078-CR-0001 cost that case all five. `casework/court_record.py` is kept and fully
tested but unwired, pending a decision on giving it its own CLI.

`casework.enrich_related_entities.plan_case_entities`
builds a per-case write plan from the resolver's decisions and
`apply_entity_plan` executes it as a single conditional (`If-Match`) whole-list
replace of `/entities` -- never a partial patch, so an existing bind and its
notes are always preserved via `merge_entity_binds`. Writes are DRAFT-only
(`REQUIRED_WRITE_STATE`) and dry-run by default: `--dry-run` prints what WOULD
bind without writing anything; `--apply` is required to actually write, and
even then `CaseworkApi` itself refuses a non-loopback host unless
`--allow-remote-writes` is also passed -- never pass that against production.

IT ALSO UPDATES ACCUSED BINDS IT DID NOT CREATE, under `--verdicts`.
`enrich_court_record` binds every court-record defendant with
`outcome = charged` and a placeholder note, because a `ठहर` on a 19-defendant
judgment does not say who. With `--verdicts`, a case with a bound court order
and an accused bind not yet settled has the judgment's operative section read
and those binds rewritten in place -- a real role note and a per-defendant
verdict -- in the SAME `/entities` replace the new binds go out in, never a
second PATCH. It still proposes no accused bind of its own. OPT-IN, because
`convicted` on a real person is the worst thing this module can get wrong.
Gated INDEPENDENTLY of the `related`-bind idempotency skip: nearly every case
this targets has already been through an extraction run.

Usage:
    uv run python -m casework.enrich_related_entities --dry-run
    uv run python -m casework.enrich_related_entities --slug case-0123
    uv run python -m casework.enrich_related_entities --limit 10 --verbose

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a Nepali legal research assistant helping to build a public transparency database of court cases.
Analyze the provided Nepali legal documents (press release and/or court order excerpts) and extract structured data.

You must extract THREE things in a single response:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PART 1 — LOCATION ENTITIES (relationship_type="location")
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Extract the district(s), municipality, or province WHERE THE CASE EVENTS occurred
or where the key assets/funds at issue are located.

STRICT RULES:
- Extract ONLY where the case events happened or where the assets are.
- DO NOT extract accused home addresses, birthplaces, or permanent addresses.
- DO NOT extract the location of courts or government inquiry offices.
- Extract 1 location for simple cases. Extract 2-3 only if the case genuinely spans
  multiple districts.
- The entity_name must be the PLACE NAME ALONE. Never combine it with an activity,
  an organisation, or anything else. The place is the entity; what happened there
  belongs in notes.
- Put the activity context in notes instead, in Nepali.

Examples of CORRECT location entities:
- "सुर्खेत"      notes: "साझा भण्डार सहकारीको कारोबार भएको जिल्ला"
- "जनकपुरधाम"    notes: "स्वास्थ्य उपकरण खरिद भएको स्थान"
- "सर्लाही"      notes: "भरत ताल निर्माण परियोजना रहेको जिल्ला"
- "खैरहनी नगरपालिका"  notes: "नापी कार्यालयको कारोबार भएको नगरपालिका"
- "काठमाडौं"     notes: "जग्गा तथा शेयर लगानी रहेको जिल्ला"

Examples of WRONG location names:
- "स्वास्थ्य उपकरण खरिद - जनकपुरधाम" ← an activity glued to a place, NEVER do this
- "घरजग्गा सम्पत्ति - काठमाडौं" ← a description of property, not a place
- "तनहुँ जिल्ला" ← accused home address, SKIP
- "काठमाडौं" ← if only reason is court/CIAA office, SKIP

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PART 2 — PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS (relationship_type="related" unless stated)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Any person or organization connected to the case.
Extract ALL of these categories that appear in the documents:

  GOVERNMENT BODIES — ministry, department, municipality, office whose funds were
  misused or where the accused worked.
  Examples: "जलश्रोत तथा सिँचाइ विभाग"  notes: "आरोपी कार्यरत रहेको सरकारी निकाय"
            "राष्ट्रिय सूचना प्रविधि केन्द्र"  notes: "खरिद प्रक्रियामा संलग्न सरकारी निकाय"

  COMPANIES/CONTRACTORS — firms, JVs, cooperatives, suppliers, foreign companies.
  Examples: "कल्पवृक्ष-कोहिनूर जे.भी."  notes: "ठेक्का प्राप्त गर्ने संयुक्त उद्यम"
            "UOB Singapore बैंक"  notes: "Singapore स्थित बैंक, रकम हस्तान्तरणमा प्रयोग"

  FAMILY MEMBERS — spouse, children, relatives holding assets.
  Example: "श्रृजना गिरी"  notes: "आरोपितको श्रीमती, सम्पत्ति हस्तान्तरण गरिएको"

  CO-DEFENDANTS/ASSOCIATES — secondary actors, facilitators, middlemen.
  Example: "नानी काजी थापा"  notes: "घुस लेनदेनमा सहयोग"

  INVESTIGATING/PROSECUTING BODIES — DO NOT extract the inquiry commission
  (अख्तियार दुरुपयोग अनुसन्धान आयोग) or special attorney office as standalone
  entities — they are present in every case. DO NOT extract individual prosecutors,
  attorneys, judges, or court staff — they are performing standard professional
  duties, not materially connected to the case events.
  Only extract named CIAA investigation officers if they are specifically named
  and their investigation is directly relevant.
  Example: "रविन्द्र कुमार बुढाप्रिथी"  notes: "अनुसन्धान अधिकृत, CIAA"

  MEDIA — DO NOT extract a newspaper, portal or broadcaster whose only role was
  REPORTING the case. It is a source, not a participant.
  Example of what to SKIP: "नयाँ पत्रिका" (published the story that prompted the
  complaint). Extract a media organisation only when it is itself accused, owns
  assets at issue, or received the funds.

Notes must never be blank for related entities. Always describe the specific connection.
Only extract entities with CONFIRMED connections — not people who were later acquitted.

DO NOT EXTRACT THE DEFENDANTS. The people the charge sheet (आरोपपत्र) names are
already held in the court record and are read from there, not from this text.
Extracting them here would guess at names the court record states exactly.
Skip them entirely — do not list them under any relationship_type.

USE A MORE SPECIFIC relationship_type INSTEAD OF "related" when the documents make
the role plain. Only these two; when in doubt use "related".

  "alleged" — named as implicated in the documents, but NOT on the charge sheet.
  Example: "नानी काजी थापा"  notes: "घुस लेनदेनमा संलग्न भनी उल्लेख, अभियोग लगाइएको छैन"

  "witness" — a named inquiry officer or witness.
  Example: "रविन्द्र कुमार बुढाप्रिथी"  notes: "अनुसन्धान अधिकृत, CIAA"

PRIORITY ORDER: People and organizations DIRECTLY involved in the case events come first.
Generic legal infrastructure (courts, attorney offices) should be skipped unless a
specific named person from those bodies is materially connected.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PART 3 — ACCUSED NOTES (accused_notes array)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
For each primary accused person named in the documents, extract a SHORT note
describing their job title and role. Format: "job title, employer"
Examples:
  "तत्कालीन प्रबन्ध निर्देशक, नेपाल टेलिकम"
  "तत्कालीन नगरप्रमुख, खैरहनी नगरपालिका"
  "नापी अधिकृत, नापी कार्यालय चाबहिल"

Only include primary accused persons. Keep notes under 80 chars.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
OUTPUT FORMAT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Output ONLY this JSON object, no other text:
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "entity_name": "Name exactly as in document",
      "relationship_type": "location", "related", "alleged" or "witness",

ENTITY CATEGORY (entity_prefix)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Every entity needs a category. CHOOSE FROM THIS LIST ONLY -- a value not on it
is discarded and the entity is not created:

{prefixes}

Pick the most specific one that fits. A person is always `person`. A district
forest office is `organization/government/district/dfo`, not `organization`.
A district is `location/district`.

Set `entity_type` to match: `Person` for a person, `GovernmentOrganization` for
a state body, `Organization` for a company or NGO, `Place` for a location.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
IS THIS A NAMED THING? (is_named_entity)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Set `is_named_entity` to true ONLY when the string names ONE SPECIFIC thing that
exists in the world and could be looked up in a register. Set it to false when
the string is a CATEGORY of thing, a description, or a phrase.

  true   "विध मानेजमेन्ट प्रा.लि."      one registered company
  true   "हेम राज विष्ट"                 one person
  true   "कर्मचारी सञ्चय कोष"            one named state fund
  false  "सामुदायिक वन उपभोक्ता समूह"   a KIND of group, not one named group
  false  "घरजग्गा सम्पत्ति"              a description of property
  false  "ठेक्का प्राप्त गर्ने कम्पनी"    a role, not a name

When false, the entity is still recorded against the case but no new register
entry is made for it. When you are unsure, answer false.

ENGLISH NAME (name_en)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Give the name in English. Many Nepali documents write English company names in
Devanagari -- convert those BACK to the English they came from rather than
spelling them out phonetically.

  "फरेष्ट डेभलपमेन्ट एण्ड इण्डष्ट्रिज"  ->  "Forest Development and Industries"

(विशेष अदालत) judgment (फैसला) to record what the court decided about each named defendant.

Decide from the OPERATIVE section only -- the ठहर खण्ड and the तपसिल directions near the \
end. The earlier sections recite the charge and the defence; they state what was ALLEGED, \
not what was decided.

The operative verbs are ठहर्छ / ठहरेको (held guilty) and सफाई पाउने ठहर्छ (acquitted). A \
defendant whose case was discontinued on death is abated (मुद्दा तामेली).

THREE SITUATIONS THE OPERATIVE SECTION DOES NOT DECIDE THE WAY IT READS.

CONFISCATION-ONLY DEFENDANTS. A spouse, parent or child is routinely captioned \
प्रतिवादी purely so their property can be attached -- "जफत प्रयोजनको लागि प्रतिवादी \
बनाएको", "असुल उपर गर्ने प्रयोजनार्थ मात्र प्रतिवादी बनाईएको". The court never \
adjudicates their guilt, so a blanket line acquitting or convicting प्रतिवादीहरू does \
NOT reach them. Answer charged for these -- never acquitted, never convicted.

A SPLIT BENCH SETTLES ONLY WHO BOTH OPINIONS AGREE ON. When the order carries a \
फरक राय, says मतैक्य हुन नसकी, or is referred on under विशेष अदालत ऐन, २०५९ को दफा ६ \
को उपदफा (४), read BOTH opinions. Answer unknown for every name they treat \
differently: that name goes to a third judge and is not decided yet. Only names \
both opinions decide the same way are settled.

AN ABETTOR IS CONVICTED. A defendant found मतियार under दफा २२ (the \
प्रतिबन्धात्मक वाक्यांश) with कैद or जरिबाना ordered is convicted, even though the \
wording differs from the main formula. Death is the ONLY route to abated \
(मुद्दा तामेली) -- a defendant who absconded, or who died after judgment, can still \
be convicted or acquitted on what the order says.

For EACH name in the accused list, answer:
  outcome   exactly one of: convicted | acquitted | abated | charged | unknown.
            Answer unknown -- never a guess -- when the operative section does
            not decide that person's case.

    extracted name and every court-record `accused` name comes through here, so
    no role can drift onto a different guard.

    `strict=False` (the default) binds the best-scoring candidate whenever one
    cleared the threshold, even if a veto fired -- with TWO exceptions, both
    spelled out at the promotion below: an unreadable entity document, and an
    election-candidate record. The cross-script refusal that used to be one of
    them was removed on 2026-08-05, so `कमल थापा` can now bind a `Kamala Thapa`
    entity. `strict=True` restores the conservative behaviour: a veto means
    REVIEW and a human decides.

    ONE NAME IN, ONE `Decision` OUT. `qualifying_binds` is what fans a promoted
    ambiguity out into several binds; this function never returns more than one.

    Completeness goes IN, so `resolve` applies the truncation veto itself
    alongside the ambiguity check it protects. `search_entities` knows whether it
    ran out of results or stopped early; before this it threw that away and the
    resolver had to guess from a row count. `search_entities` always returns a
    `CandidateList` carrying the real answer. The `True` default covers a caller
    that hands over a plain list -- a stub, or a hand-built set -- which is
    describing exactly the candidates it means, so taking it at its word is right
    rather than cautious-by-reflex. Nothing in production reaches the default.

    A BIND then still needs the document veto: the search payload alone cannot
    tell a real case subject from an Election Commission candidate record sharing
    their name. The second read is wrapped so ANY exception maps to an unreadable
    document, which the veto downgrades to REVIEW. Fail closed -- a transient
    read failure must never let a BIND survive.

    """Resolve every extracted name for one case and build its write plan.

    Guarantees: never plans a write for a non-DRAFT case, or for a case whose
    payload does not carry an `entities` key at all (see below); only BIND
    decisions that also survive the document veto and the truncation guard
    reach `patch_items`; every item this planner adds is validated before it
    lands there; and the merge emits NOOP when nothing changes, so a re-run is
    idempotent.

    No `required_state` parameter: an earlier version let a caller merge
    against IN_REVIEW, which is exactly what REQUIRED_WRITE_STATE's own
    reasoning above forbids -- IN_REVIEW is publicly retrievable, so a
    non-casework read blanks `notes`, and merging that redacted snapshot into
    the whole-list replace would wipe every existing note. Pinned directly so
    there is no keyword that can reopen that hole.

    `"entities" not in case` is refused rather than merged: `case.get(
    "entities") or []` cannot tell "this case has no binds" from "this payload
    does not carry binds at all" (e.g. a caller passed a trimmed dict). Both
    server read paths do include `entities` today, so this is a defensive
    guard against a payload shape that would otherwise silently plan a
    destructive whole-list replace with every existing bind missing.

    Every extracted name binds into the section its own `relationship_type`
    names, for any of the nine the case API accepts. Three kinds of name do not
    bind: an unrecognised section (no place to file it), a name no NES entity
    matched at all (nothing to file), and an `accused` bind that would escalate an
    entity the case already characterises another way (a human's call, not this
    module's -- see the guard below).

    Bind identity is `(nes_id, relationship_type)`, matching the DB's
    `unique_case_entity_relationship_type` constraint, so one entity may hold two
    binds on a case under different sections. A re-run still produces the same
    pairs and so still writes nothing.

    Scope is a deliberate product decision, not a safety margin, and it was
    widened on request: an earlier version bound `related` only and read
    `accused` solely from the NGM court record, refusing `location` and the rest
    before spending a search. That cost recall -- the resolver bound 33 of 39
    labelled names, the shipped allow-list only 26 -- and the recall is what was
    wanted. `strict=True` restores the old refusals for anyone who needs them.

    What this means in practice, stated plainly because it is the real cost: in
    the default permissive mode a name with several equally-good namesakes binds
    to whichever sorts first, so some binds WILL name the wrong person. The
    run's `*.binds.jsonl` records the reason and the runners-up for every such
    bind, which is the audit trail for finding them again.

    EVERY name here comes from the extraction. `accused` is a section the LLM may
    put a name in like any other; it is no longer also read from the case's NGM
    court record. That path was removed because it needs neither a document nor an
    LLM, so sitting inside this module put it behind five gates it has no use for --
    a case with a complete court record bound zero defendants whenever its
    press-release PDF lacked a MARKDOWN role, or the LLM call failed. See
    `casework/court_record.py`, which is kept and tested but unwired.

    TWO GUARDS SURVIVE PERMISSIVE MODE. Both draw the same line: the caller chose
    to accept uncertainty ABOUT a match, not to invent one.

    1. `apply_document_veto`'s FAIL-CLOSED branch. `api.get_entity` is wrapped in a
       bare try/except, and ANY exception (timeout, 403, 502, a renamed/404 entity)
       or an empty body means the document was never read -- which stays REVIEW.
       Which namesake is right is a judgement the caller chose to accept; an HTTP
       failure is not a judgement at all, and promoting it would bind on evidence
       nobody ever saw. The exception's own text is folded into the reason (and
       logged), so a misconfigured base URL is diagnosable rather than looking like
       a real veto.
    THE CROSS-SCRIPT REFUSAL IS GONE. It used to be the second guard: a
    candidate with no Devanagari name only scored through romanisation, which
    folds a masculine name into its feminine form. Removed on 2026-08-05 when
    the review queue was dropped, so a case charging `कमल थापा` can now bind a
    `Kamala Thapa` entity. Recorded here because this is the function that plans
    the write, and a reader must not infer a guard that no longer exists.

    merge into the case, the `plan.nomatch` entries no entity could be made for,
    and one report row per name for `*.created.jsonl`.

    `items_by_key` maps `(name, bind_section(item))` back to the extracted item
    the metadata must come from -- the prefix, the type, the English name, the
    notes and the `is_named_entity` gate. KEYED ON THE SECTION TOO, because one
    name can be extracted twice under two sections with contradictory metadata,
    and keyed on the name alone both `plan.nomatch` entries read whichever the
    model emitted last. That is not a tie-break, it is a safety gate decided by
    output order: a contractor extracted as `related` with `is_named_entity:
    true` was refused because a same-named `witness` row said false.

    `run_entities` maps `(prefix, normalised name)` to an IRI already created
    THIS RUN, and is shared across cases on purpose. Case 078-CR-0038 named the
    Dhangadhi forest directorate twice in one extraction; without it, that case
    creates two entities on its first run, and two cases naming the same office
    create two more.

    THE PREFIX IS PART OF THE KEY, and must stay part of it. A person and an
    organisation can carry the same name, and they live at different IRIs
    (`person/ram-bahadur-thapa`, `organization/ram-bahadur-thapa`) that the
    server will never 409 against each other. Keyed on the name alone, the
    second case reuses the first's IRI and binds a PERSON as the organisation
    in a corruption case. The name still carries within a prefix, so two
    spellings of one office -- or one office whose `name_en` the model wrote
    differently in two cases, which would otherwise slug apart -- still collapse
    to one entity.

    A dry run POSTs nothing and still reports the IRI it would have used, built
    from the same prefix and slug, so the printed patch is the one an `--apply`
    run would send.

    Nothing here raises. A name that cannot become an entity -- no prefix, a
    prefix with no existing parent, an unslugifiable name, a failed POST -- is

    One function so every refusal reads the same way in `created.jsonl`, and so

    1. SECTION. NES already holds all 77 districts under official codes
       (`location/district/kailali-np0771`), from a gazetteer ingest. A location
       created here is therefore always a duplicate of a canonical district or
       junk -- there is no third case. Bind them, never mint them.
    2. NAME SHAPE. `_name_vetoes` is the resolver's own judgement that a string
       is too weak to identify anything: a composite `Activity - Location`, a
       lone token, an all-generic institution name. It no longer blocks binding
       (2026-08-05), but a string the resolver will not trust to MATCH is not
       one to CREATE from.
    3. THE MODEL'S VERDICT. `is_named_entity` is the only gate that can tell
       `सामुदायिक वन उपभोक्ता समूह` -- a kind of group -- from a named one.
       `_name_vetoes` cannot: its generic rule needs EVERY word in a 53-word
       list, and neither सामुदायिक nor समूह is in it.

       ABSENT MEANS NO. A prompt regression that drops the field then surfaces
       as `0 created` in the summary, which is visible and fixable; defaulting
       the other way fills NES with entries nobody can delete.
    4. IDENTITY. Prefix, type, slug -- can we even build an IRI. An unreadable
       prefix list is refused here too, but says so in as many words: it is the
       one refusal that reports a failure to check rather than a check that
