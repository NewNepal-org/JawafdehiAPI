## Features

- Track allegations against public entities

- Timeline management for allegations
- Response system for accused entities
- RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
- Integration with Nepal Entity Service (NES)
- Admin interface powered by Jazzmin (Bootstrap 4)

## Permissions Model

### Case Revisions

Each allegation uses a revision system to track changes:
- **Published version** - The current live allegation visible to the public
- **Draft revision** - Edits create a new revision in Draft status
- Revisions maintain history of all changes to an allegation

### Allegation Status Workflow

#### Creating New Allegations
1. **Draft** - Initial status when an allegation is created
2. **In Review** - Contributor submits the draft for review (visible to Moderators)
3. **Published/Closed** - Moderator approves and sets final status

#### Editing Existing Allegations
Editing a published allegation creates a new revision:
1. User edits the allegation (creates a new draft revision)
2. Submits for review (revision status: **In Review**)
3. Moderator approves, changing revision status to **Draft**, **Published**, or **Closed**
4. If approved as Published, the new revision becomes the live version

### User Roles

#### Admin
- Manage all Moderators (create, edit, delete, assign permissions)
- Manage all Contributors (create, edit, delete, assign to cases)
- Full access to all Allegations, Evidence, Sources, and Responses
- Assign Contributors to specific cases

#### Moderator
