# **Public Accountability Platform (PAP) High Level Plan**

[Let’s Build Nepal (LBN)](https://letsbuildnepal.com) and [NewNepal.org](http://NewNepal.org) are partnering to build a public, civic tech[^1] accountability platform to hold Nepali public entities (individuals as well as organizations) accountable. Among other things, we will document and host corruption cases involving Nepali entities on a case-by-case basis on a website accessible by the Nepali public.

# **Vision Summary**

* **Central Corruption/Accountability Database:** Host a public database compiling misconduct allegations against Nepali public entities (individuals and organizations) from various sources (government, NGO, media, etc.).  
  * **Public Accessibility:** Allow the public to view allegations and audit trails; content will be publicly accessible and freely usable, including on social media.  
  * **Integrity & Moderation:** The PAP team will compile, verify, and approve all database content and updates, though crowdsourced information is encouraged.  
* **Information and Knowledge Portal:** Provide Nepali citizens with critical information and knowledge (laws, regulations, rights) to promote accountability in governance, in an easily understandable format (online portal supporting English and Nepali).  
* **Right to Respond:** Allow alleged entities to respond to accusations, presenting their responses alongside the allegations.  
* **Protection and Privacy:** Aim to protect both the alleged and public contributors against online threats and ensure privacy (e.g., removing sensitive personal identification information).

# **Why (Now): A Gen Z Mandate for Accountability**

The GenZ revolt was united around a central demand to tackle the problem of corruption. Moving forward into this New Nepal, the PAP will provide a platform to improve accountability of public entities through the development and use of a publicly accessible, open database, and at the same time being useful for researchers for studying governance challenges in Nepal. This addresses several issues at once::

1. **Fragmented Information:** Information regarding allegations of misconduct, corruption cases, and misuse of public resources is scattered across numerous government reports, disparate media sources, and NGO documents. There is no single, centralized, and publicly accessible repository for Nepali citizens to easily track accountability failures over time.  
2. **Lack of Transparency:** Many public reports and legal documents are often complex, inaccessible, or only available in formats that are difficult for the average citizen to understand and utilize. A simple, citizen-friendly platform is needed to translate and contextualize this information.  
3. **Empowering the Citizenry:** Effective democracy requires an informed public. By providing critical information on laws, regulations, and the track records of public entities, the PAP aims to empower Nepali citizens to actively participate in demanding accountability, making informed voting decisions, and curbing corruption at the local and national levels.  
4. **Deterrence through Documentation:** A **public**, permanent, and verified record of allegations and related audit trails creates a powerful deterrent against future misconduct by public entities. The platform's commitment to verifiable information and a 'Right to Respond' mechanism ensures fairness while promoting transparency.

# **Platform Scope and Methodology**

1. Types of allegations:  
1. Allegations of corruption, regardless of their current or past investigation by government authorities.  
2. Allegations of misconduct (such as the recent Madhesh chief minister [issue](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2025/11/10/province-head-bhandari-appoints-saroj-kumar-yadav-as-madhesh-chief-minister))  
3. Breaching the trust of the people (such as by serial lying)  
4. Politicians’ promises: before vs after elections  
1. Sources:  
   1. Nepal government  
   2. NGOs (e.g. Transparency International)  
   3. Media and Journalists  
   4. Public websites, including wikis.  
   5. Direct crowdsourced data (will be verified before publication). The website will have a submit page for allowing anyone to submit allegations with evidence.  
2. Accessibility:  
   1. The database will allow the public to view the allegations pertaining to individuals and events, including an audit trail of modifications made to the information presented for traceability.  
      1. They can search for cases of interest using search filters.  
   2. The portal will be publicly accessible (including being in both Nepali and English) and its contents can be freely used.  
   3. Content will be made accessible in social media from dedicated social media accounts.  
3. Modification and integrity:  
   1. The PAP team will prepare the initial database and perform regular updates. Content will be scraped from various sources, and compiled and verified by moderators.  
   2. While the portal will encourage the public to provide crowdsourced information pertaining to cases and alleged entities, the PAP team will ultimately be responsible for verifying and approving the changes.

# **Kinds of Peoples Involved (Actors and more)**

1. Nepali citizens/contributors  
   1. Access portal, report allegations, provide website feedback  
   2. They can choose whether their website contributions are added to the audit trail with their name or anonymously.  
2. Entities (public individuals/organizations)  
   1. Respond to allegations. For verification of identity, they must communicate using established social media pages, video calls, or other forms of identities. No special login.  
3. Moderation team  
   1. The moderation team will verify reported allegations, and update the database.  
4. Outreach team  
   1. The outreach team will reach out to other people and organizations for collaboration and more.  
5. Advisory team  
   1. The advisory team will provide opinions on operations, vision, and strategy.  
6. Development team  
   1. The development will handle the software development and server administration.  
7. Data team

# **🏛️ System Components**

The Accountability Portal will consist of several component pillars that together facilitate that our public platform will ensure (or improve) accountability of Nepali public entities.

1. Web Application: A web application accessible by the public to view and submit allegations.  
2. Web service: The layer that   
3.   
4. Data/Database: The layer that stores the allegations  
1. 

# **Web Application**

# **Web UI/UX Design**

The web application/website for the PAP will enable Nepali public to browse through the PAP Web API that facilitates information retrieval from the PAP database.

## **`Roadmap:`**

1. Identify frontend use cases. Please refer to the [Vision](#heading=h.4cww7zx3oozp) section to identify what should go here.  
2. Identify UI workflows to meet the use cases  
3. Build mockups  
4. Develop software  
5. Deploy the software.

## **`Pages:`**

- Landing page  
- Report allegation page  
- Search results page (can be incorporated in home page)  
- Allegation page (dedicated page about an allegation)  
- Entity details page  
- Information page (what is corruption? How do we vet? etc.)  
- About

## **`Other information:`**

For frontend developers, if you would like to get started, please start by reading the [API guide](https://nes.newnepal.org/consumers/api-guide) for the NepalEntityService.

We need a dedicated section in the website (e.g. a page or a group of page) for informing the Nepali citizenry about what allegations are.

The home page should seek to explain, in the minimum, about us and the project, the workflows, the allegation parameters (e.g. what constitutes).

# **Web Backend**

# **PAP Component Design**

## **`NepaliEntityService (NES)`**

[https://nes.newnepal.org](https://nes.newnepal.org)

The EntityService loads the entity database and exposes endpoints for search, lookup, versions, and relationships. This will live in the public domain.

It will expose APIs like `/entities` (entity search/retrieval) and `/relationships` (relationships between entities search/retrieval).

## **`NepalEntityService (NES) database`**

[https://github.com/NewNepal-org/NepalEntityService-database](https://github.com/NewNepal-org/NepalEntityService-database)

The entity database is a file system-based database. This will live in the public domain. An entity refers to public persons, organizations, and government bodies.

## **`JawafdehiService (JDS)`**

The JawafdehiService will build on top of the Entity Service and develop an `/allegations` API (search/retrieval), and a `/report` endpoint that allows the submission of allegations.

Alongside, we will need

1. A management portal to moderate allegations  
2. A system to notify moderators whenever an allegation is made.

## **`Allegations database`**

The JDS will store the allegations on a separate database called Allegations. Unlike the public entities database, it will not be publicly accessible due to the sensitivity of accusations and possibility of Publicly Identifiable Information (PII).

# **Sourcing Database**

# **Database Sourcing**

A critical challenge in PAP is to ensure that the two databases it uses (Entity DB and the Allegations DB) are populated and are kept up-to-date. For the initial sourcing and regular updates, we must build scrapers that can ingest information from various sources.

## **Sourcing needs**

1. The system ingests structured and unstructured data from approved government registries, NGO datasets, media articles, and vetted citizen submissions.  
2. The system normalizes names, dates, organizations, and roles, and it resolves duplicate identities across Nepali and English spellings.

## **Sourcing Workflow**

*TODO: To Complete*

The NES service features a [migration workflow](https://nes.newnepal.org/contributors/workflows) that allows developers to keep adding/updating `person`s, `organization`s and other kinds of entities.

The NES service also provides a CLI that can be used to scrape information from public websites (Note: this feature is still under development). See the [Scraping Guide](https://nes.newnepal.org/contributors/scraping-service-guide) for more info. We should extend the scraping functionality to be able to extract allegations.
